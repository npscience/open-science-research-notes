On May 16, I gave a 15-minute talk at the Cambridge Computational Biology Institute annual symposium (Twitter #CCBI18).

Slides are openly available, CC-BY eLife, at [bit.ly/eLife-at-CCBI-2018](http://bit.ly/eLife-at-CCBI-2018) — this opens a view-only Google Slide presentation.

# User research
As part of the talk, I asked the audience (~80 researchers from across Cambridge departments and institutes, common interest: computational biology) to first reflect on:
1. Why they share their research? ([Aims](#aims-for-sharing))
2. How they share their research? Are there ways they hack the current system? ([Methods](#methods-of-sharing))

I used post-it notes, set out around the room before the session for attendees to write on. I collected these post-it answers back in at the end and have collated the answers here, in case of interest or use to others. Some answers were repeated, I've not indicated quantities here.

## Aims for sharing

* Exposure. Show my contributions.Visibility.
* Consolidation: "Wrap up old tasks so I can concentrate on what I’m doing now"
* Dissemination of findings and methods and ideas. - to share and to seek validation. Create awareness.
* Reach lots on people (incl. scientists). The take-home message should be accessible.
* Add new info/understanding to the community. Impact: so society understands it and makes an impact on the lives of those who need it most. Advance science.
* Get feedback. Invite inputs to improve the outcome. Diversity in feedback - different viewpoints.
* Reproducibility, quality control, validation, a reality check.
* Encourage re-use (tools, code, open source) & improvement (analysis methods)
* Encourage contributions/improvements (code/analysis methods/other); encourage people to build on your work. “Having someone solve the problems I could not.”
* Get other people excited about the topics I’m passionate about
* Generate new ideas, new directions for future work.
* Skills exchange and connection.
* Funding (requirement?)

## Methods of sharing

* Short video instead of abstract; images.
* Preprints: bioRxiv
* Conventional publication
* Website / blogs (e.g. describe and share data) - share these links when presenting the paper
* Online database
* Data in repositories (dryad)
* Open source code (github)
* Interactive table and graphical data in the publication
* Jupyter / binder (not yet)
* Online dissemination (social networks, twitter)
* Conferences - inc talks pre-publication.
* Mainstream news outlets (the conversation, podcasts, participation in public workshops)
* Share with students in workshops
* Networking
* Collaboration
* Discussions
* Lectures

One post-it seemed to be a suggestion/request:
* Good atmosphere for discussion and feedback

# Reflections

Many thanks to the CCBI 2018 attendees who engaged with this user research process. It was an experiment for me and I learnt a lot.

## What worked
I found it to be an effective and efficient way to crowdsource user research when I'm at a conference.

I think this was a good way to engage the audience and regain attention after 1h30 of science straight after lunch. I hope it helped people to reflect on why eLife was on stage, and what that might mean for them personally.
*Did it? Please feel free to add an issue to this repo or email me (see slides).*

## What could be improved
A 15-minute talk slot, plus 5 mins for Qs, wasn't sufficient for discussion. Doing this meant no live Qs this time.

One thing I'd try next time is to ask the audience to share their own post-it as part of the Q&A, instead of spending time collecting them all in then reading from them.
*Any other suggestions? Please feel free to add an issue to this repo or email me (see slides).*
