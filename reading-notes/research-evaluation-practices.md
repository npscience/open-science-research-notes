# Grant review

* [TO READ IN FULL] Gallo et al June 04 2019 preprint [biorxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/479816) on why people review grants: not because the funder asked them to but because they think it's part of their contribution to science. In return, they feel it improves their own grantsmanship (they learn how to write better grants) and exposes them to new scientific ideas; but not everyone is involved in grant review.
