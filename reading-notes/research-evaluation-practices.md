# Grant review

* [TO READ IN FULL] Gallo et al June 04 2019 [bioRxiv preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/479816) on why people review grants: not because the funder asked them to but because they think it's part of their contribution to science. In return, they feel it improves their own grantsmanship (they learn how to write better grants) and exposes them to new scientific ideas; but not everyone is involved in grant review.
* [TO READ IN FULL] Severin, Martins et al June 19 2019 [PeerJ Preprint](https://peerj.com/preprints/27587/) about biases in grant review at SNSF depending on applicant and reviewer gender & other characteristics, based on nearly 40,000 grant applications reviewed at Swiss National Science Foundation.
