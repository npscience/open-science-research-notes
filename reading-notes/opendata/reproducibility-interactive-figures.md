In brief: most useful way to support reproducibility is to share methods and data in full. Interactive figures beneficial.
 * Asks both eLife authors and researchers at one insitution -- mixed awareness of interactive figures
 * Full survey data is at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4436912.v6
 * Focusses on attitudes and understanding of readers; what aobut those of authors who are preparing these interactive figures? (Does preparation of interactive figure improve the completeness/presentation of the methods and data?)
 * version history is on biorxiv -- includes author's note as to the revision updates (good to see a log of changes!) -- https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/581033v2.article-info
