# Notes

*[xx] refers to references as numbered by the author, see in the original preprint*

* Author did policy research for UK govt while on secondment there; this is the write up (as individual, not endorsed); author is based at UCL Energy Institute: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/dr-michael-fell
* Methods: quick lit review using expert-advised search terms and methods. Specifically about open access publishing and open data, not other forms of open science.
* Documents some trends and stories, eg.:
 * Efficiency: “doing the same with less input” / doing more with same input
  * Difficulty accessing papers → time spent (~50 mins x 17 hard-to-access articles per year) = 70m Euro/yr [17] 
  * Enabling TDM of research outputs → if TDM enabled 2% increase in productivity (~45 mins per academic per week), additional productivity of £123.5-156.8m (in working time per year) [16]
 * Enablement: increasing the likelihood of economic impact, creating possibilities
  * Human Genome Project -- data were made publicly available within 24 hours of discovery, project funded with $3.8billion, “generated ‘an economic (output) impact of $796 billion, personal income exceeding $244 billion, and 3.8 million job‐years of employment’ [21]” -- as of report published in 2011. In comparison, Celera’s data with IP restrictions has been estimated to have had 20-30% lower impact (in subsequent research and product development) [46]
  * 45% users of the European Bioinformatics Institute’s databases could not have found or created the data they use themselves [15] -- so many outputs derived from EBI data exist because the data is open
* Author notes in several places that hard to compare open v closed as no/limited controlled studies on this, some examples to base conjectures on.
* Author makes recommendations based on findings:
 * 1. Promote and support new open collaborations
 * 2. Streamline text and data mining
 * 3. Develop an open access findings/data portal targeted at business
 * 4. Produce aligned positions and guidance on open science and commercialization
 * 5. Continue support for open research data repositories
 * 6. Continue research into new metrics and incentives
