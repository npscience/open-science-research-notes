# Unintended consequences of open science mandates?

* rough quote: ‘mandatory data sharing could cause researchers to delay publication to exploit data as much as possible themselves, ultimately decreasing value for wider research community’ [Fell 2019] Fell M.J. The Economic Impacts of Open Science: A Rapid Evidence Assessment. Preprints 2019, 2019050302 DOI:10.20944/preprints201905.0302.v1. [my notes](/reading-notes/opendata/economic-impact.md)
* Gates Foundation mandated open-access publishing → pushback by researchers, Gates paid Science $100m/year for open access, 16 articles were published in Science by Gates-funded researchers in the first year [Nature News article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05729-2); did lead to developments that enabled Gates’ grantees to publish OA in Science, NEJM, PNAS and Nature.
* Many reactions to Plan S
* Complex system of who influences who: consider co-authors at other institutions & with other funders, individual career progress, institutional reputation and economic impact, value of science in society
