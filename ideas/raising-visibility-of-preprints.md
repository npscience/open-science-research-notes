Proposal fleshed out for eLife Sprint 2019 application: [here](https://github.com/npscience/transparent-opportunities/blob/master/events/elife-sprint-2019.md).

Opportunities:
* discovery of preprints beyond twitter network
* identify preprints by authors who are less visible in traditional Global North publishing venues --> top of the pile for review, filtering?

Existing tools / initiatives
* Open Knowledge Maps indicate increasing visibility of African research as reason for partnering with AfricArxiv: https://info.africarxiv.org/strategic-partnership-with-open-knowledge-maps/
* PREreview wants to review preprints in a way that is more inclusive than traditional peer review ??
* EuropePMC indexes preprints-- what could they do to display indicators of which preprints could be given attention?
* PreLists is new initiative by CoB to curate lists of preprints -- what are the assumptions and biases of the curators? How might they mitigate?
