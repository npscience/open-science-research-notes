# The vision
* Fair Open Access Principles -- https://www.fairopenaccess.org/the-fair-open-access-principles/
* AmeliCA: global south perspective.
* Plan S: european perspective, lots of dialogue. Criticism = focus on author-pays-APC model (even if funders subs this), check update to see if renewed focus on green OA. Criticism from global south: high pricing structure would exclude contributions from researchers with low/no funding.
* Plan U: funders mandate preprints -- this funds access to initial content but doesn't fund peer review

# The current situation
Many journals publish more magazine content than original research articles: https://twitter.com/brembs/status/1144168071332073473

* base costs are $400/article ($200-$1000 across scenarios)
* Supporting data at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8118197.v1 (note some data provided in private)
* Note these are base costs of publishing, across several scenarios (fixed versus variable costs, at different scales, different toolchains)
* Discussion highlights additional costs for magazine content, marketing, innovation [*and what about maintenance of the software/infrastructure?*; Authors do talk about everyone using the one infrastructure ecosystem & therefore splitting costs]
* Authors invited open review at https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=d69db412-df26-4f06-8604-f599745fb5b8
* Alex Holcombe calculates potential savings if article price matched cost: https://twitter.com/ceptional/status/1143803890082574336
 * and recommends following these other sites re fair pricing for science publishing: https://freejournals.org/ & http://psyoa.org/
